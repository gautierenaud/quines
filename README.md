# Quines

This is a repo to have fun with quines.
I got interested from this site: [quines inspiration](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html).

Next ideas:
* make the code as small as possible
* compress part of it
* add mutation mechanisms
* add neuronal network
* mix quines
* absorb code


## 01 Simple quine

This directory contains a simple quine, that will display it contents.

## 02 Cleaner quine

Tried to have several chunks of hex encoded code, instead of one big string.

## 03 Mutate quine

Try to include some mutations:
* deletion: a code line simply disappear
* duplication: a code line is duplicated somewhere
* comment: a code line is commented (is it a *mute*-ation ? :p )
* uncomment: a code line is ... uncommented (duh !)
* random mutation: one char is randomly mutated to something else
