# Quines

This is a repo to have fun with quines.
I got interested from this site: [quines inspiration](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html).

Next ideas:
* make the code as small as possible
* compress part of it
* add mutation mechanisms
* add neuronal network
* mix quines
* absorb code


## 01 Simple quine

This directory contains a simple quine, that will display it contents.

## 02 Cleaner quine

Tried to have several chunks of hex encoded code, instead of one big string.
